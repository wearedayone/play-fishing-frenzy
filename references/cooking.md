# Cooking Reference

## Workflow

1. Call `get_recipes()` to see today's active cooking recipes
2. Check if you have the required fish types in inventory
3. Call `cook(recipe_id, quantity, fish_ids)` to create sashimi
4. Sell sashimi for pearls, or spin cooking wheel

**Rule**: Only cook if you have enough matching fish. Don't buy fish just to cook.

## Cooking Wheel

Spend pearls to spin the cooking wheel for xFISH rewards. The Efficiency strategy prioritizes cooking wheel spins.
