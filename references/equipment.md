# Equipment & Accessories Reference

## Rods

- Check rod condition via `get_inventory()`
- Repair before durability reaches 0 — a broken rod can't fish
- If you have multiple rods, equip the one with best stats

## Accessories (Upgrades)

Call `get_accessories()` at session start. If you have unspent upgrade points, spend them.
